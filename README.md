This  repository contains the solutions of the competition was organised by the Analytics vidhya ,to classify the different  ships on the basis of their features.


# Problem Statement
Ship or vessel detection has a wide range of applications, in the areas of maritime safety, fisheries management, marine pollution, defence and maritime security, protection from piracy, illegal migration, etc.

Keeping this in mind, a Governmental Maritime and Coastguard Agency is planning to deploy a computer vision based automated system to identify ship type only from the images taken by the survey boats. You have been hired as a consultant to build an efficient model for this project.

# Dataset Description
There are 6252 images in train and 2680 images in test data. The categories of ships and their corresponding codes in the dataset are as follows -

There are 5 classes of ships to be detected which are as follows:
